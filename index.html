Now I would tell all the people to adopt because cats are very faithful beings and they make you smile when you need it most, adopting is one of the best things that can happen to them in life"

That how they treat us does not define who we really are. Since then, she fills me with surprises and lessons; We have been growing together and she has been my partner in this amazing journey"

When I see him hugging the sheets with his eyes half-closed, I know I did the right thing by opening my front door for him"
